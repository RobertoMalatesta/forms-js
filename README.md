Forms JS is a form validation library intended to provide a backbone for other, framework-specific libraries.

## Installation

First install the toolchain with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/):

```shell
npm install
```

Now you can build source like so:

```shell
npm run build
```

And run tests like so:

```shell
npm run test:watch
```

Note that tests are run on *built* source so be sure to build first.
